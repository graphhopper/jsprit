/**
 * A {@link ReverseActivityVisitor} that looks forward in the vehicle route and determines
 * the maximum capacity utilization (in terms of loads) at subsequent activities.
 *
 * <p>Assume a vehicle route with the following activity sequence {start,pickup(1,4),delivery(2,3),pickup(3,2),end} where
 * pickup(1,2) = pickup(id,cap-demand).<br>
 * Future maxLoad for each activity are calculated as follows:<br>
 * loadAt(end)=6 (since two pickups need to be delivered to depot)<br>
 * pickup(3)=max(loadAt(pickup(3)), futureMaxLoad(end))=max(6,6)=6
 * delivery(2)=max(loadAt(delivery(2),futureMaxLoad(pickup(3))=max(4,6)=6
 * pickup(1)=max(7,6)=7
 * start=max(7,7)=7
 * activity (apart from start and end), the maximum capacity is determined when forward looking into the route.
 * That is at each activity we know how much capacity is available whithout breaking future capacity constraints.
