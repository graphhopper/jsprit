     * <p>
     * When you check activities, you need to understand the following:
     *
     * Let us assume an existing route;
     *
     * start, ..., i-1, i, j, j+1, ..., end
     *
     * When inserting a shipment, two activities will be inserted, pickupShipment k_pick and deliverShipment k_deliver,
     * i.e. jsprit loops through this route (activity sequence) and checks hard and soft constraints and calculates (marginal) insertion costs. For
     * the activity sequence above, it means:
     *<p>
     * start, k_pick, start+1 (prevAct, newAct, nextAct)<br>
     * ...<br>
     * i-1, k_pick, i<br>
     * i, k_pick, j<br>
     * ...<br>
     *<p>
     * accordingly:<br>
     * start, k_pick, k_delivery (prevAct, newAct, nextAct)<br>
     * ...<br>
     * i-1, k_delivery, i<br>
     * i, k_delivery, j<br>
     * ...<br>
     *<p>
     * You specify a hard activity constraint, you to check whether for example k_pick can be inserted between prevActivity and nextActivity at all.
     * If so, your hard constraint should return ConstraintsStatus.FULFILLED.<br>
     * If not, you can return ConstraintsStatus.NOT_FULFILLED or ConstraintsStatus.NOT_FULFILLED_BREAK.<br>
     *
     * Latter should be used, if your constraint can never be fulfilled anymore when looping further through your route.
     *<p>
     * Since constraint checking at activity level is rather time consuming (you need to do this thousand/millions times),
     * you can memorize states behind activities to avoid additional loopings through your activity sequence and thus to
     * check your constraint locally (only by looking at prevAct, newAct, nextAct) in constant time.
     *
     * @param iFacts JobInsertionContext provides additional information that might be important when evaluating the insertion of newAct
     * @param prevAct the previous activity, i.e. the activity before the new activity
     * @param newAct the new activity to be inserted in between prevAct and nextAct
     * @param nextAct the next activity, i.e. the activity after the new activity
     * @param prevActDepTime the departure time at previous activity (prevAct) with the new vehicle (iFacts.getNewVehicle())
     * @return fulfilled if hard constraint is met, other not fulfilled.
