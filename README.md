jsprit
======

jsprit is a java based, open source toolkit for solving rich [Traveling Salesman Problems(TSP)](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Travelling_salesman_problem) and [Vehicle Routing Problems(VRP)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vehicle_routing_problem).
It is lightweight, flexible and easy-to-use, and based on a single all-purpose [meta-heuristic](docs/Meta-Heuristic.md) currently solving

- Capacitated VRP
- Multiple Depot VRP
- VRP with Time Windows
- VRP with Backhauls
- VRP with Pickups and Deliveries
- VRP with Heterogeneous Fleet
- Time-dependent VRP
- Traveling Salesman Problem
- Dial-a-Ride Problem
- Various combination of these types

Setting up the problem, defining additional constraints, modifying the algorithms and visualising the discovered solutions is as easy and handy as
reading classical VRP instances to benchmark your algorithm. It is fit for change and extension due to a modular design and a comprehensive set of unit and integration-tests. [More features ...](https://github.com/graphhopper/jsprit/blob/master/docs/Features.textile)
