**v1.5** @ 2014-12-12
<b>! Break change !</b>

It only breaks your code if you already build your algorithm from scratch since strategies now need to have unique ids. just add a unique id to the SearchStrategy constructor.

<em>jsprit-core</em>
- renaming of core.problem.constraint.HardActivityStateLevelConstraint into HardActivityConstraint
- renaming of core.problem.constraint.HardRouteStateLevelConstraint into HardRouteConstraint
- StateFactory.createId(String name) moved to core.algorithm.state.StateManager.createStateId(String name)

- VehicleRoute: <del>getCosts()</del>, <del>getCostCalculator()</del>
- TimeBreaker --> TimeTermination, VariationCoefficentBreaker --> ...Termination, Iteration...Breaker --> ...Termination
- VehicleRoutingAlgorithm: setPrematureBreaker(...) --> setPrematureTermination(...)
- util.<del>Counter</del>
